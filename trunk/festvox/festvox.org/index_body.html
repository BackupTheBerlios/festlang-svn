      <strong>Jan 24th 2007</strong>: <A HREF="http://festvox.org/blizzard/">Blizzard Challenge 2007</A>

The call for participation in the third Blizzard Challenge is posted.
Blizzard is a multi-site challenge to build a synthetic voice from a
common database that will be evaluated by a large number of listeners.

      <strong>Jan 21st 2007</strong>: <A HREF="http://festvox.org/bsv/">Festvox-2.1 Release</A>

Festvox-2.1 has been released.  New with this release is Clustergen
Statistical Parametric Synthesis support, EHMM acoustic labeler (no
longer dependent on Sphinx) Thanks to Kishore, Voice Conversion
support (thanks to Tomoki Toda), and cygwin support.  See <a
href="http://festvox.org/bsv/ANNOUNCE-2.1">ANNOUNCE-2.1</a> for more
details.

      <strong>Dec 29 2006</strong>: <A HREF="http://hts.ics.nitech.ac.jp/">HMM-Based Speech Synthesis System HTS-2.0</A> has been released. 

HTS version 2.0 now supports adaptation and adaptive training
based on MLLR.  MAP-based adaptation is also supported.  This
version does not include any text analyzer yet, but you can use
the Festival Speech Synthesis System as a text analyzer.  This
distribution includes demo scripts using CMU ARCTIC database
(English).  Six HTS voices for Festival 1.95 are also released.
They are based on our small synthesis engine which has been
included as a module of Festival.  Each of the HTS voices can be
used without any other HTS tools.

      The Festvox project aims to make the building of new synthetic
      voices more systemic and better documented, making it possible 
      for anyone to build a new voice.  Specifically we offer:
      <UL>
      <li><A HREF="festvox/festvox_toc.html">Documentation</A>, including scripts 
      explaining the background and specifics for building new voices for
      speech synthesis in new and supported languages.</li>
      <li>Specific scripts to build new voices in supported languages,
      such as US and UK English.</li>
      <li>Aids to building synthetic voices for 
      <A HREF="ldom/index.html">limited domains</a></li>
      <li><A HREF="dbs/index.html">Example speech databases</A>
      to help building new voices.</li>
      <li>Links, demos and a repository for new voices</li>
      </ul>
      FestVox version 2.0: Jan 2003: new in this release
      <ul>
      <li>Better clunits general voice support</li>      
      <li>Support for CMU Sphinx and SphinxTrain to build acoustic
      models for labeling</li>
      <li>DOCBOOK version of the documentation, with more general 
      backgfround documentation</li>
      <li> Initial support for Mac OS X </li>
      <li> configure support to match Edinburgh Speech Tools</li>
      </ul>
      The documentation, tools and dependent software are all free without
      restriction (commercial or otherwise).  Licencing of voices built 
      by these techniques are the responsibility of the builders.

      This work is firmly grounded within Edinburgh University's 
      <A HREF="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/">

      <p>
      This work has been supported be various groups including,
      Carnegie Mellon University, the US National Science Foundation
      (NSF), and US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

      Note the techniques and processes described here do not guarantee
      that you'll end up with a high quality acceptable voice, but with a 
      little care you can likely build a new synthesis voice in a supported
      language in a few days, or in a new language in a few weeks (more or
      less depending on the complexity of the language, and the desired
      quality).
      <p>
      You will need:
      <ul>
      <li>To read the <A HREF="festvox/festvox_toc.html">documentation</A></li>
      <li>A Unix machine (e.g. Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, etc) with working
      audio i/o.  This may work on other platforms but many scripts,
      perhaps unnecessarily, depend on Unix utilties like,
      <tt>awk</tt>, <tt>sed</tt> etc.</li>
      <li>Installed versions of Edinburgh University's
      <A HREF="http://festvox.org/festival/downloads.html">
      Festival Speech Synthesis System</A> and 
      <A HREF="http://festvox.org/festival/downloads.html">
      Edinburgh Speech Tools</A> (distributed with Festival).</li>
      <li>A waveform viewing/labeling program like 
      <tt>emulabel</tt> distributed as part of Macquarie University's
      <A HREF="http://www.shlrc.mq.edu.au/emu/">EMU speech database
      system</A>.  Although automatic labeling software is included in
      festvox, a display tool is necessary for diagnosis and debugging.</li>
      <li>Patience and care, and a little interest in the subject of speech
      technology.</li>
