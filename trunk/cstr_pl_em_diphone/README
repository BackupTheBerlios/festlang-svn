This directory contains a basic Polish synthesizer based on the work
by Dominika Oliver as part of her Masters at the Dept of Linguistics
University of Edinburgh in the summer of 1998.

This synthesizer was converted to the festvox.org format at
CMU in Summer 2000 by Alan W Black (who originally supervised
Dominika).

At present this is made available for non-commercial use
only as we feel it needs significant tidy up before it can be
considered complete.
