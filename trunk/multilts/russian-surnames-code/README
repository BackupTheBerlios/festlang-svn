This code transcribes Russian text.

============
Compilation
============

	Under UNIX just type 'make'. It should be compiled with Visual Studio
	as well, there is dsw project.

=======
 Usage
=======
	
	lts program just reads string by string from standard input and
	outputs transcription to standard output. The text should be in 
	KOI8-R encoding. Program can be actually converted to any other encoding
	without a problem, but it requires some code modification (dictionary
	should be sorted to make binary search work properly).
	

	Example:
	
	[shmyrev@gnome code]$ ./lts
	василий петрович голохвастов
	pau v ao ss i ll ae ij sylbreak pp ei t r o vv ae ch sylbreak g ae l ao h v a s t ao v pau
	
	If you want to exit program, just type Ctrl+D

====================
 Implementation notes
====================

	The text is splitted onto words, then each word is converted to initial list
	of phonemes according to LTS rules. Then stress is predicted either with the
	dictionary or with classification and regression tree. As a last step vowels
	are reduced according to the predicted stress.

==================
Results
==================

	Current tree shows around 92.3% correct prediction at independant data. And dictionary contains
	500 most frequent names and second names and 500 most frequent families. It incorrectly predicts
	only 1300 proper names from our 13000 proper names lexicon. Considering that some names
	can have different stress I think results are satisfactory.
