GnomeVoiceControl
====================

GnomeVoiceControl is a speech recognizer to control GNOME Desktop.
It allows you to define simple commands for running browser and
text editor but also can do much more complicated things like
toolbar items activation, text navigation and many more.

Installation
============

If you have libraries installed in non-standard prefix, you'd probably
need to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable. The rest is usual
configure && make && make install. Please make sure bonobo activation
server correctly finds .server file with applet description. If not
adjust BONOBO_ACTIVATION_PATH environment variable and restart session.

Please also note that you must have accessibility enabled and must use C
locale since we only support English now. Go to
Preferences/Acessibility/Assistive Technologies and enable them.

Once the applet is installed you can add it to the GNOME panel. Right
click on the panel, select Add to Panel, in the section Miscellaneous
you will found a icon VoiceControl, add it.

To start the real control over desktop, click with the right button on 
the VoiceControl applet area and select Start Control. The system will
pass by the states Idle -> Calibrating -> Ready. When the system is
ready you can start to speech, giving the commands by voice. If speech
is detected applet will show Listening and in the end of command it will
run it. If it doesn't work or system locks on calibration please check
your mixer settings and sound recording system setup.

The functions to control windows that we implented are:

  1 - RUN TERMINAL     : open gnome-terminal
  2 - RUN BROWSER      : open Epiphany
  3 - RUN MAIL         : open Evolution
  4 - RUN TEXT EDITOR  : open GEdit
  5 - CLOSE WINDOW
  6 - MAXIMIZE WINDOW
  7 - MINIMIZE WINDOW
  8 - NEXT WINDOW

We can control menus too. For example in GEdit you can try something
like

  2 - HELP .. ABOUT
  3 - SAVE
  4 - PRINT
  5 - UNDO
  6 - PASTE
