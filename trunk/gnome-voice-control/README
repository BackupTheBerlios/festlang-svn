Installation
============

If you have libraries installed in non-standard prefix, you'd probably
need to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable. The rest is usual
configure && make && make install. Please make sure bonobo activation
server correctly finds .server file with applet description. If not
adjust BONOBO_ACTIVATION_PATH environment variable and restart session.

Or link .server path in /usr/lib:

  sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_VoiceControlApplet_Factory.server /usr/lib/bonobo/servers/

Please also note that you must have accessibility enabled. Go to
Preferences/Acessibility/Assistive Technologies and enable them.

Compiling GVC 0.6
========================

1º.- Modify configure.ac to select the ASR engine (sets RECOGNIZER variable).

2º.- Compile:
./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/
make

3º.- Install
sudo make install


GVC Start
============

Once the applet is installed you can add it to the GNOME panel. Right
click on the panel, select Add to Panel, in the section Miscellaneous
you will found a icon VoiceControl, add it.

To start the real control over desktop, click with the right button on 
the VoiceControl applet area and select Start Control. The system will
pass by the states Idle -> Calibrating -> Ready. When the system is
ready you can say command. If speech is detected applet will show 
Listening and in the end of command the notification will appear. If it
doesn't work or system locks on calibration please check your mixer
settings and sound recording system setup.

Sphinx Languages
=========

We support a number of languages now with http://voxforge.org models. In
order to use Spanish, German or Russian with Sphinx you need to do the following. 
Download acoustic model for sphinx3 and place it in 

$pocketsphinx_prefix/share/pocketsphinx/model/hmm/voxforge-$LN 

just beside the wsj1. Check that files in the model folder has the same
layout as in wsj1. Run applet it your locale, it must automatically
detect the language. In order to add support for a new language, please
contact developers. But remember it's a very labour work.
